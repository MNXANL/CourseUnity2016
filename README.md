# CourseUnity2016
Repo with some projects I made for a Unity Course, in 2D and 3D. Also has a kind-of-FPS prototype I made after the course (but never got to finish), AirPulse

* **Day1**: test project
* **Days2and3**: test project
* **Days6animation**: animation tests
* **MiniProject**: duh
* **ParkourRunner**: Mirror's Edge bad clone
* **Runner2D**: vaporwave runner
* **AirPulse**: Prototype of an MP FPS where you are at the top of a skyscraper and you have to take down your enemies by throwing them down... because your weapon can't do any damage, only push them away!
